# VRE Portal

## Getting Started

### Frontend

This is the front end react application of Indoc VRE project. The back end is on server `http://10.3.9.241:8000`. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The back end is on `./server` folder.

#### Prerequisites

+ nodejs: ^12.16.3
+ npm: ^6.14.4

install both npm and nodejs on `https://nodejs.org/en/`

#### Pull the Repo

open a terminal, execute `git clone git@git.indocresearch.org:charite/core.git&&cd ./Core/portal`.

#### Install dependencies

run `npm i` on the `ROOT/portal` folder to install all the dependencies.

#### Run the Application

run `npm start` to start the React application. You can access the webpage on `localhost:3000` after it starts.

#### Build a Production Version

run `npm build`. After the compilation completed, the minimized static files are in `./build`. You can use any other backend to serve these files.

#### Eject

Since the webpack tool configs are hidden in this version of Create-React-App, you can run `npm eject` to get access to all these config files.  
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
