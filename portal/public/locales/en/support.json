The Project Name is a user-friendly, descriptive title that makes it easier for users to find the Project in the VRE. The Project Name can only be changed by the project Administrator."

          "question": "What is Project Visibility and how can I change it?",
          "answer": "Visibility is a Project attribute that controls whether a Project's basic information (Project Title, Project Code and description) are visible to all VRE users in the Landing Page. Visibility does not affect which users can be added to a Project.",
          "visibility": "The Visibility of a Project is controlled by the Administrator and can be edited on the Project Information page by selecting or deselecting the checkbox “Make this project discoverable by all platform users”. If the checkbox is selected, any user logged into the VRE can see the Project’s Title, Code, and description in the VRE landing page, but only invited Team Members can enter the Project. If the option is deselected, no users outside of the invited Project Team Members will be able to see the Project in the Landing Page."

          "answer": "A file can only be uploaded into an approved Project by an invited Project Member (Administrator or Contributor). As an invited Project Member of the Project, you have been authorized to contribute data to the project. All VRE members are responsible for abiding by the Platform Terms of Use and all Project Members must ensure that they only upload authorized data that is appropriate to the Project.

          "answer": "The Files Panel will appear in the bottom right of your screen after you initiate a file upload. Your most recent upload will appear at the bottom of the list and will have a green \"Success\" indicator if uploaded successfully. If you need to open or close the Files Panel, click on the Files Panel icon at the bottom of the Right Sidebar.
