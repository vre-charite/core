          "Administrator": "The Project Administrator is a Principal Investigator or delegate who has overall responsibility under GDPR as Data Controller for the Project data and has the authority to invite other research members to the Project. Administrators can view all Project data in the VRE Green Room and Core, modify Project information, and add additional users to the Project.",
          "Collaborator": "The Project Collaborator is a member of the Project whose primary role is data analyst. Members with this role can contribute, or upload, data to the Project, view the list of files they uploaded to the Project, and download the files that they originally uploaded.

          "question": "What is a Project?",
          "answer": "A Project is a data storage and processing container that holds all the data files for a VRE-approved research project. VRE-approved means that the research project has been assessed by the Charité VRE Governance Manager and Data Protection Officer as having all the necessary approvals and safeguards in place for data processing to occur in the VRE."

          "question": "What is the difference between Project Code and Project Name?",
          "answer": " The Project Code is a persistent character-based code created by the VRE Onboarding Team that uniquely identifies the Project in the VRE. Once created, it cannot be changed. The Project Name is a user-friendly, descriptive title that makes it easier for users to find the Project in the VRE. The Project Name can only be changed by the Project Administrator."

        {
          "question": "What is Project Visibility and how can I change it?",
          "answer": "Visibility is a Project attribute that controls whether a Project's basic information (Project Title, Project Code, and description) is visible to all VRE users in the Landing Page. Visibility does not affect which users can be added to a Project.",
          "visibility": "The Visibility of a Project is controlled by the Administrator and can be edited in the Project Settings page by switching the visibility toggle on or off. If the Project is set to 'Discoverable by all platform users' any user logged into the VRE can see the Project Title, Project Code, and description on the VRE landing page, however, only invited Team Members can enter the Project. If visibility is turned off, only invited Project Team Members will be able to see the Project on the Landing Page."

          "question": "Who can initiate a Project?",
          "answer": "Once REB approval has been received for a research project and a service agreement is in place, the Project can be created and configured in the VRE by a Platform Administrator, who will grant access to the first Project Administrator."

          "answer": "The platform detects user sessions that have been inactive for more than thirty minutes. This is done for security reasons and helps enhance the overall speed and security of the platform. Before expiring inactive sessions, the VRE will warn you. To confirm that your session should remain active, click 'Refresh'. If your session has expired, you will be required to log back in with your username and password."

As a Project Member of the Project invited by an Administrator, you have been authorized to contribute data to the project. All VRE members are responsible for abiding by the Platform Terms of Use and all Project Members must ensure that they only upload authorized data that is appropriate to the Project. Please contact your Project Administrator if you believe you should have a different user role."

If you click on the File Status card, your most recent upload will appear in the \"In Progress\" section until it has uploaded successfully. The \"Uploaded\", \"Downloaded\", \"Approved\", and \"Trash Bin\" pages will show you the other files that have been successfully processed during your current session.

          "answer": "The Green Room is a segregated data zone for the storage of data with personally identifiable information. Within the Green Room environment, hospital data can be de-identified, transformed, and prepared prior to being transferred to VRE Core systems. The VRE Core is an environment designed to support the full lifecycle of data after being deidentified in the Green Room. In the VRE Core, de-identified hospital data can be securely stored, federated, and analyzed."

A single file can be added to multiple Collections and adding or removing files from Collections does not affect the file's storage location or data lineage. Collections are made by selecting files in the VRE Core and selecting \"Add to Collection\". Currently, all collections are private and cannot be viewed by other users."
